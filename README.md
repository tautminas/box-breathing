Box Breathing is a web application designed to help practice the box breathing technique, which is known to reduce stress and improve mental clarity. The application visualizes breathing cues using a square and a moving sphere that guides the user through the four phases of box breathing: inhale, hold, exhale, and hold.

The application is developed using vanilla JavaScript and incorporates Three.js for 3D visualizations. Vite was used as the development and build tool.
